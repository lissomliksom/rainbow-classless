# rainbow-classless

One small CSS-file to make your HTML look nice.

Demo: [lissomliksom.github.io/rainbow-classless](https://lissomliksom.github.io/rainbow-classless)

## Goals

* Everything needed - all styles, all variables - in one file.

* No classnames, nothing new to learn. Write semantic HTML and everything looks nicer by default.

* Works across different browsers and units (tested in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, my phone and a couple of tablets).

* A very lightweight version of my complete CSS-framework, Rainbow (*coming not soon*).
